# Terminal Practice

### Context
Interesting fact about me: I really like to travel and go on vacations. I'm not a big social media guy, but I'm an organized guy, and I like to organize my vacations into a very specific structure. So let's take a look at what sort of directory and file structure my most recent one would have.

### The Warmup
1. Navigate to `~/TIY/warmups`
2. Create a directory `basic-terminal`
3. Navigate inside `basic-terminal`
4. Create the following folder/file structure:
	```
	+ 2016-08-disney-land
	   |
	   |-- summary.txt
	   |
	   +-- photos
	   |    |-- mickey-mouse.jpg
	   |    |-- minnie-mouse.jpg
	   |    |-- donald-duck.jpg
	   |  
	   +-- journal
	   |    |-- day1.txt 
	   |    |-- day2.txt
	   |    
	   +-- misc
	   |    |-- restaurants.csv 
	   |    |-- main-attractions.csv	
	```
